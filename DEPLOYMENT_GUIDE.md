# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix - Your files are ready!

Your Simple Programming Language web CLI is now fixed and ready for GitHub Pages. Here's exactly what to do:

### Step 1: Repository Setup
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a **new repository**
2. Name it something like `simple-programming-language` or `spl-cli`
3. Make sure it's **public** (GitHub Pages requires this for free accounts)
4. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
Upload these files to your repository root:
- `index.html` ✅
- `style.css` ✅  
- `script.js` ✅
- `README.md` (optional)

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)**
6. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Access Your Site
- GitHub will give you a URL like: `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`
- It may take 5-10 minutes to be live
- The site will show your `index.html`, not the README!

## 🔧 What I Fixed
- Fixed HTML structure (terminal-buttons div was missing)
- Added proper CSS classes to input field
- Fixed the executeCommand function to use runUserCode
- Cleaned up spacing and syntax

## 🧪 Test Locally First
Open `index.html` in your browser to test:
1. Wait for "Ready! Your programming language is loaded." 
2. Try: `x = 5`
3. Try: `x + 3`
4. Try: `2 + 3 * 4`

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
- If GitHub Pages shows README instead of your site, make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- If the terminal doesn't work, check browser console (F12) for errors
- If Pyodide doesn't load, try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

## 📁 Your File Structure Should Look Like:
```
your-repository/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md (optional)
```

You're almost there! The hard part is done. 🎉
